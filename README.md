### What, how, why?

- An Intelligent AI Chatbot that attemps to mimic human conversation

- Trained the chatbot model by feeding it a curated list of patterns associated with corresponding tags and responses

- Developed in Python and built using TensorFlow and Keras

- Aims to offer 24/7 support for users, whether it be asking the time, to tell a joke, or even career advice

### What's next?

- Integrate API endpoints that fetch real-time data for certain queries to provide a better experience for the user
  - For example: fetching stock data for Amazon or fetching nutrition information about a particular food item
